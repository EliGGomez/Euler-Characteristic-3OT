### Euler characteristic computation by means of Three Ortogonal symbol chain code

The Euler characteristic is one of the most interesting topological properties of a binary object contained in a 2D image, $I(x, y) \epsilon \{0, 1\}$, it gives a global description of the shape of the object and is unaffected by any deformation as it is invariant under linear and non-linear geometric transformations of the image.
